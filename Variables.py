#Variables

''' Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.
So we can dynamically asign any value to a memory location just by naming it
'''

# example 

name="something"

'''this name is now of type string  
you can find out its type by typing following command'''

print(type(name))

''' this statement will return following output

<class 'str'>

which means this is a string type variable
'''

#now lets change value of name

name=10  #Remember there are no semicolons (;)😁👍👍

'''
now again printing the type of name 
we will ge the following output
'''

print(type(name))

'''output of above statement will be as below 

<class 'int'>

this means that there are no specific data type associated with variables 
They are randomly generated and assigned in the memory
'''
